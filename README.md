# _MTA-Turnstile-Analysis
### by Brian K, Chris G, Jeremy B, and Laura C.
Problem Statement: Our goal is to recommend times and locations to place WomenTechWomenYesâ€™s street teams. Street teams will be placed at MTA subway stations to maximize attendance and contributions to WTWY summer gala. We will analyze traffic volume and local income data. We will also examine proximity to large, local technology companies to balance maximizing attendance versus maximizing contributions. By incorporating IRS income data by zip code, our goal will be to identify a set of subway stations and days of the week for WTWY to optimize the placement of their street teams for collecting signatures.
